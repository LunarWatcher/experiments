This repo is a collection repo of misc. experiments. The code here is mainly kept as a public archive, and because it's low-quality experiments, the code quality is likely questionable. If you plan to use anything from this repo, please remember that this repo is not a shining example of anything.

There are two possible experiment states; `ended` and `ongoing`. If you're looking for examples of stuff to point and laugh at, I suggest looking at experiments that have ended and not experiments that are still ongoing.

This repo is intentionally undocumented, aside the bare minimum I need to understand the code, and some various results. Please don't open issues asking for docs.

---

Current experiments in reverse chronological order:
* `factorio-stack`: test game based on the same core stack as Factorio (SDL2, Allegro5, AGUI)
* `raylib`: test game with raylib that ended up just being screwing around with fonts
